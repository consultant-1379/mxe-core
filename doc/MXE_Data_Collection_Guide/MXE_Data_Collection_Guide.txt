== Data Collection

The data needed for troubleshooting a fault is collected by running a series of commands and collecting the logs files.

[[CollectClusterRelatedData]]
=== Collect Cluster Related Data

. Log on to a node from which the cluster can be accessed using the kubectl command.
. Run the following commands to collect the output data:
+
....
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get cs

[[PackagingCollectedData]]
=== Packaging Collected Data

Package the collected data into a tar ball for submission to the next level of Support.

[[SplitFilesbeforeAddingtoCSR]]
== Split Files before Adding to CSR

Before adding the archive file to the CSR as an enclosure, it must be split into smaller pieces according to the appropriate enclosure limits.

. Run the following command:
+
....
split -d -b <piece>MB --verbose data_collection_<date>.tar.gz data_collection_<date>.tar.gz.part.
....
+
Where `<piece>` is less than the enclosure limit, for example, 500 MB.
+
. Pieces can be put together with the `cat` command. Add the following information to the CSR:
+
....
cat data_collection_<date>.tar.gz.part.* > data_collection_<date>.tar.gz
....

[[SubmitCSR]]
== Submit CSR

.Enclose the created archive in a CSR and submit it to the next level of support:
. Transfer the collected data content `.tar` file out of the system.
. Submit the file as part of the CSR.
