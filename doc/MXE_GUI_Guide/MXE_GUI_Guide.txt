[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Machine Learning Model Execution Environment (MXE) is a web-based GUI that covers a subset of the functionality of the Command Line Interface (CLI). It presents information about the status of the system and the models in a clear and concise manner, including health, utilization, model quality, and so on.

It is divided into the following main tabs:

* *Dashboard*
* *Model Packages*
* *Model Services*
* *Flow Deployments*
* *Training Packages*
* *Training Jobs*
* *Notebooks*

All of the above tabs have a set of common GUI elements, detailed in the following sections.

Access rights are configured via Roles in Keycloak. Roles can be directly assigned to users or you can define groups with a set of roles and add users to the groups.

Associating an access privilege with a domain for a particular target or all targets is configured via Role attributes:

....
Key: domain name
Value: <target>:<privilege>;<target>:<privilege>
....

NOTE: `target` can be omitted if `privilege` is defined for all targets.

[[GlobalRoles]]
=== Global Roles

*Administrator* global role is introduced to help handling permission changes in the GUI.

[[CreateaRole]]
=== Create a Role

Create a role:

. Make sure you are in the MXE realm by checking in the top left corner.
. Click on the *Roles* menu on the left.
. Click on the *Add Role* button.
. Give the role a name and an arbitrary description.
+
NOTE: Roles meant to be used for access control must start with the `mxe_` prefix.
+
. Select the *Attributes* tab to setup access privileges.
. Assign this role directly to the user or create a group then add the role to it and join the user to the that group. See sections <<AssignaRoletoaUser,Assign a Role to a User>>, <<CreateaGroup,Create a Group>>, and <<JoinUserintoaGroup,Join User into a Group>>, respectively.

*Examples of role attribute settings:*

....
Key: com.ericsson
Value: models:all;model-services:read
....

This role makes sure that the user can get, list, onboard, and delete models, but can only get and list model services in the com.ericsson domain and all of its subdomains.

....
Key: com.ericsson
Value: models:read
....

This role makes sure that the user can only execute non-modifying operations (read, list) on the models in the com.ericsson domain and all of its subdomains.

....
Key: com.ericsson.something
Value: all
....

This role makes sure that the user can execute all available operations on all models and model services in the com.ericsson.something domain and all of its subdomains.

....
Key: com.ericsson.something
Value: read
....

This role makes sure that the user can only execute non-modifying operations (read, list) on all models and model services in the com.ericsson.something domain and all of its subdomains.

....
Key: *
Value: all
....

This role allows the user to execute all available operations on all targets in any domain.

NOTE: The asterisk `*` character can only be used as in the above example. It cannot be used as a wildcard otherwise.

WARNING: Subdomains can only be more permissive, than the domain they belong to.

For example `com.ericsson=all, com.ericsson.internal=read` is properly configured, while `com.ericsson=read, com.ericsson.internal=all` is not.
