        rationale:
          descriptionOfUsage: 'CVE-2016-20013 is reported by anchore grype and trivy.
            It is related to DoS due to CPU consumption caused by flaw in sha256crypt
            and sha512crypt. MXE is not impacted by this cve because do not use passwords
            hashed using sha256/512 crypt.


            Description: This CVE is reported in the following images in ubuntu OS
            package libc-bin argocd:v2.7.7-ubuntu-20230624 certificate-sidecar:ubuntu-20230624

            As per the CVE sha256crypt and sha512crypt through 0.6 allow attackers
            to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) because the algorithms
            runtime is proportional to the square of the length of the password.


            MXE does not use passwords hashed using sha crypt.


            Hence this CVE is not applicable. Also this CVE is marked as low priority
            by Ubuntu and has been marked as "Deferred" as per https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2016-20013'
          impact: Not Applicable

            when processing a crafted regular expression. This CVE can be only exploited
            in applications which take regular expressions as untrusted input. Hence
            MXE is not vulnerable to this CVE.

        rationale:
          descriptionOfUsage: "CVE-2018-5709 is reported in package related to kerberos.\
            \ There is a variable \uFFFDdbentry->n_key_data\uFFFD in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c\
            \ that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned\
            \ a \uFFFDu4? variable to it which is for 32-bit data. This vulnerability\
            \ can be used by attackers to affect other artifacts of the database MXE\
            \ does not use Kerberos as authentication mechanism. Hence any vulnerability\
            \ detected in Kerberos is not applicable to MXE.\n\nDescription: CVE is\
            \ detected by XRay tool in following images in MXE: argocd:v2.7.7-ubuntu-20230624\
            \ mxe-gitea:v1.16.7-ubuntu-20230624-rootless mxe-memcached:1.6.9-r159-ubuntu-20230624\

            \ libkrb5-3:1.17-6ubuntu4.3 libgssapi-krb5-2:1.17-6ubuntu4.3 libkrb5support0:1.17-6ubuntu4.3\n\
            \nMXE does not use Kerberos as an authentication mechansim. Hence MXE\
            \ is not impacted by any vulnerability in Kerberos.\n\nAlso as per the\
            \ analysis by JFrog Research The prerequisites for exploiting the CVE\
            \ are extremely unlikely: a) Requires the user to restore the Kerberos\
            \ Database from a crafted malicious file. b) A Kerberos database is not\
            \ restored often. The attacker must find a way to get the user to restore\
            \ the database from a crafted file. If the attacker has access to the\
            \ backup file it can be modified even without exploiting this vulnerability.\
            \ The vulnerability only helps by making the attacker's modifications\
            \ to the backup file seem legitimate when manually inspected. c) The integer\
            \ truncation doesn't affect data allocated near the 16-bit integer and\
            \ doesn't have any meaningful impact. d) The CVSS does not reflect the\
            \ fact that the vulnerability does not have any security impact."

            Description: This CVE is reported in the services: mxe-gitea.

            is part of ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04 that is used as base OS image for
            these services. As per CVE description, this is a kernel level vulnerability.


            Container images do not have a kernel and it uses the Kernel from the
            host machine where it runs. So, if the docker image runs in a host that
            has the vulnerable Linux kernel, this has to be fixed in the host.

          descriptionOfUsage: 'CVE-2021-22569 is reported in eric-mxe-jupyterlab and
            spark-operator service. This CVE is originated in protobuf-java that allows

            Description: This CVE is reported in the eric-mxe-jupyterlab and spark-operator
            service as part of protobuf-java.


            As per the CVE description the protobuf-java that allows DOS attack for
            a specific way of execution. Given the specific requirement to exploit
            this CVE it requires a very specific way of execution. Protobuf comes
            as a transitive dependency of spark in jupyterlab/spark-operator service.


            Jupyter notebook is a development environment for data scientists. It
            is part of mxe-exploration package which is an optional component and
            access to it is protected by ADP IAM layer.


            Spark Operator is an Kubernetes Operator (packaged in MXE in mxe-workflow
            which is an optional component) used to run Spark applications from Argo
            Workflow. MXE includes this distributed data processing component [spark-operator]
            which can be used to build data pipelines using Argo Workflow. The K8s
            manifest submitted to the workflow will be validated by argo/spark CRDs
            at K8s layer.


            This CVE requires the attacker to know the very specific way of building
            the payload and pass that into the spark job such that it is parsed by
            the jars. Even if someone exploits this vulnerability it will only impact
            the jupyterlab/spark-operator pod for the same user.


            Of course it will consume resources (CPU/Memory) of the node but the impact
            is limited to the pod. On the other hand we''ve already implemented jupyterlab/spark-operator

            As per CVE description JSONParserByteArray in JSON Smart versions 1.3

            json-smart comes as a transitive dependency of hadoop-client-runtime jar.
            Jupyter notebook is a development environment for data scientists. It
            is part of mxe-exploration package which is an optional component.


            Spark Operator is an Kubernetes Operator (packaged in MXE in mxe-workflow
            which is an optional component) used to run Spark applications from Argo
            Workflow.


            MXE includes this distributed data processing component [spark-operator]
            which can be used to build data pipelines using Argo Workflow. The K8s
            manifest submitted to the workflow will be validated by argo/spark CRDs
            at K8s layer. As mentioned in the https://github.com/netplex/json-smart-v2/issues/67
            there is no Deny of Service factor in this project. If this bug is used
            it will just reject the JSON with an incorrect error message. Having said
            that even if there is DOS it is only applicable to spark operator service
            in MXE and this should be contained by the resource quotas.

            of protobuf-java and this flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of
            service (DoS). This library is not explictly invoked in MXE and in case
            of exploit the impact is limited to only the user specific workloads.
            Hence the impact is low.


            Description: This CVE is reported in the services: eric-mxe-jupyterlab
            spark-operator


            As per CVE a potential Denial of Service issue in protobuf-java core and
            lite was discovered in the parsing procedure for binary and text format
            data. Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral platform-neutral extensible
            mechanism for serializing structured data.


            In spark operator service: It is detected in the "PkgName": "com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java"
            in the "PkgPath": "opt/spark/jars/hadoop-client-runtime-3.3.2.jar".


            In jupyterlab service: It is detected in the "PkgName": "com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java"
            in the "PkgPath": "opt/conda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyspark/jars/protobuf-java-2.5.0.jar".


            In both the services MXE did not defined any proto definition to persist
            data or to parse the persisted data. protobuf-java is installed as a transitive
            dependency as part of apache spark.'
          impact: As the result of this vulnerability is denial of service attack
            even if someone exploits impact is limited only to the respective pod
            of jupterlab instance and spark executor instance [both are user specific]
            and it will not impact cluster operations and the core functionalities
            of MXE. Also as per the protobuf community https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2
            the severity is "Moderate".
          likelihoodOfAttack: MXE do not explicitly use Protocol Buffers. And so from
            MXE point of view we don't see a way the services could be exploited.
          severityBasedOnRiskAssessment: MEDIUM

            This library is a transitive dependency and is not used explicitly by

            the BCP 47 tag parser has quadratic time complexity due to inherent aspects
            of its design. Since the parser is by design exposed to untrusted user

          descriptionOfUsage: 'CVE-2022-41723 is reported in multiple go based services
            of MXE. This CVE is originated in "golang.org/x/net". As per CVE description
            attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by maliciously crafted
            HTTP/2 stream. This library is a transitive dependency and is not used
            explicitly by MXE. The attacker would need to bypass multiple layers of
            protection to achieve the exploit hence the impact is "low".

            This is reported in the package "golang.org/x/net".


            As per CVE description a maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause
            excessive CPU consumption in the HPACK decoder sufficient to cause a denial
            of service from a small number of small requests.


            Except argocd and gitea rest all services is not directly exposed to the
            external world. Argocd and Gitea opens up only for OAM operations and
            it is protected by authentication layer ADP IAM and resource quotas at
            the container level. '
          impact: 'The opportunity for a Denial of Service is limited to the golang
            runtime and this would be restricted within each individual container
            service mentioned in the description. '
          likelihoodOfAttack: This is a transitive dependency and the possibility
            of explotation is minimal. Malicious users would need access to the services
            to be able to attack and on top of this there are multiple layers of protection
            (resource constraints imposed at the container and even there will be
            at cluster levels imposed by Infra team) which would require a malicious
            user to continue submitting attacks for there to be any enduring impact.

            As per CVE Insufficient filtering in Go''s html/template leads to XSS
            when executing crafted templates. In MXE vulnerable functions are not
            used and hence it is not affected.


            Description: CVE-2023-24539 is reported in multiple go based services.


            As per CVE description "A flaw was found in golang where angle brackets
            (<>) were not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts.
            Templates containing multiple actions separated by a ''/'' character could
            result in the CSS context unexpectedly closing allowing for the injection
            of unexpected HMTL if executed with untrusted input."


            MXE does not make use of html/template. Exploitation of the issue is only
            possible when the vulnerable component is used in a specific manner. The
            attacker has to perform per-target research to determine the vulnerable
            attack vector. The attackers must find a remote input that propagates
            into a Go template that is subsequently rendered with Template.Execute
            or Template.ExecuteTemplate. This is highly unlikely and is considered
            a bad practice regardless of this vulnerability. Given the understanding
            and analysis we mark this as not applicable.

          descriptionOfUsage: 'CVE-2023-29400 is reported in multiple go based services.
            As per CVE Insufficient filtering in Go''s html/template leads to XSS
            when executing crafted templates. In MXE vulnerable functions are not
            used and hence it is not affected.


            Description: CVE-2023-29400 is reported in multiple go based services.


            As per CVE description "A flaw was found in golang. Templates containing
            actions in unquoted HTML attributes for example "attr={{.}}") executed
            with empty input could result in output that has unexpected results when
            parsed due to HTML normalization rules. This issue may allow the injection
            of arbitrary attributes into tags."


            MXE does not make use of html/template. Exploitation of the issue is only
            possible when the vulnerable component is used in a specific manner. The
            attacker has to perform per-target research to determine the vulnerable
            attack vector. The attackers must find a remote input that propagates
            into a Go template that is subsequently rendered with Template.Execute
            or Template.ExecuteTemplate. This is highly unlikely and is considered
            a bad practice regardless of this vulnerability. Given the understanding
            and analysis we mark this as not applicable.

            It is reported in pcre2 and as per CVE description "goproxy v1.1 was discovered
            to contain an issue which can lead to a Denial of service (DoS) via unspecified
            vectors.". goproxy provides a customizable HTTP proxy library for Go (golang).
            Gatekeeper is an OAuth proxy which integrates with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
            providers like Keycloak it supports both access tokens in a browser cookie
            or bearer tokens. This service is not exposed to end-users and used within
            MXE to intereact with IAM and other services. The request from client
            comes via ingress controller and then it lands on Gatekeeper.


            MXE has already implemented Resource Quota (CPU/memory limits) to prevent
            from hogging of CPU and Memory. Also gatekeeper runs with High Availability
            (HA) with 3 replicas by default and hence bringing down this service via
            DOS attack will need large number of requests from attacker.

          impact: MXE has already implemented Resource Quota (CPU/memory limits) to
            prevent from hogging of CPU and Memory. Also gatekeeper runs with High
            Availability (HA) with 3 replicas by default and hence bringing down this
            service via DOS attack will need large number of requests from attacker.
            Hence the impact is "LOW".
          likelihoodOfAttack: Likelihood of attack is very minimal because ingress
            controller will block incorrect requests. This can be exploited only when
            gatekeeper service is exposed directly via port-forward to end-users which
            is not a production use case.
          severityBasedOnRiskAssessment: MEDIUM
        status: PEE_UT
      mitigation: Resource quota and High availability is implemented for gatekeeper
        service to prevent from DOS attack. However MXE has plans to replace gatekeeper
        in newer generation of MXE which is already in scope. MXE track is currently
        into maintainence mode and so no fix is planned.

            error that has an unknown impact and attack vector.


            For services: eric-mxe-model-python-base eric-mxe-training-python-base
            eric-mxe-kafka-pyconsumer This is false positive as in both these services
            the certifi version is 2023.7.22 which is not impacted as per https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-xqr8-7jwr-rhp7.
            This is a bug from grype tool for which the reference is provided: https://github.com/anchore/grype/issues/1417


            For services: Jupyterhub and Jupyterlab The containers of these services
            has a strict security context: ReadOnlyFileSystem. Hence e-Tugra root
            certificate cannot be removed as mentioned in the vulnerability.

        rationale:
          descriptionOfUsage: "Argocd shipped within \"mxe-deployer\" package in MXE.\
            \ Helm is used by argocd internally and it is not exposed outside for\
            \ a human user to exploit the options.\n \nAlso, \n- MXE is not supplying\
            \ any helm plugins.\n- index.yaml is managed by argocd and helm operations\
            \ handled within argocd. Hence, there is no room for exploitation.\n \n\
            And \"mxe-deployer\" package is an optional component from MXE and it\
            \ is not used for any MXE related core-features whereas it is delivered\
            \ to stakeholders for them to leverage it for their respective use cases.\n\
            Considering the above analysis, MXE do not have impact."
          impact: No impact for MXE.
          likelihoodOfAttack: Reported HELM is not exposed outside and it is used
            for M2M communication. Hence, the likelihood of attack is considered as
            none.
          severityBasedOnRiskAssessment: NONE
        status: NA
      mitigation: As explained in the description, likelihood of attack & impact,
        there is no mitigation required. Even though there is no impact, as a security
        best practice vulnerable package will be uplifted in the next planned release
        if the fix is available.

            \ invoked. Having said that the end-user could invoke this JAR but predicting\
            \ those use cases is out of the scope for MXE. And it is the responsibility\
            \ of the end-users to cautiously handle while invoking vulnerable functionalities.\
            \ \n\nFor other services:  \nIt is a transistive dependency for kubernetes\

          impact: No impact to MXE considering the analysis
          likelihoodOfAttack: As this component is not explicitly used/invoked in
            the MXE, the likelihood of the attack is considered as none.

        rationale:
          descriptionOfUsage: 'In MXE, this CVE is reported in the gitea image of
            libc dev component. But as per CVE description, it is a Kernel vulnerability
            related to qualcomm product


            MXE runs on containerized environment where as this vulnerability describes
            about the kernel weakness.


            Container images do not have a kernel and it uses the Kernel from the
            host machine where it runs. So, if the docker image runs in a host that
            has the vulnerable Linux kernel, this has to be fixed in the host.


            Given the above analysis, this CVE is not applicable for MXE.'
          impact: Based on analysis, no impact considered for MXE.
          likelihoodOfAttack: As it is a host OS kernel level vulnerability, there
            is no Likelihood of attack.
